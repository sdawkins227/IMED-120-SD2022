Intro to Media Comp. Spring-2022
1. Cat Catching Game
- The player will be able to control the charecter using the right and left arrows on the players keyboard. 
- The game play will consist of fish jumping out of the water and will require you to catch them in your net to earn points in a given time. Maybe 60 seconds? Blue fish are worth 1 point, yellow fish are worth 5. As you earn more and more points, the fish will jump out of the water faster and faster making them harder to catch. 
- The win condition is to catch 50 fish,  the lost condition is if you miss more than 20 fish (keeping into acount that yellow fish are worth 5 points), the game ends. If you catch a spiked pufferfish, the whole catch is spoiled, thus, losing the game.
